# TheGreatNovel MVP Rewrite

A **deterministic, event-sourced, replayable game simulation core** designed to be tested by scripted and LLM agents.

## Current Status

**Phase 7 — frozen at `phase-7-frozen`**

**Phase 7.5 — frozen at `phase-7.5-frozen`**

**Phase 8 — frozen at `phase-8-frozen`**

**Phase 9A — frozen at `phase-9a-frozen`**

**Phase 9B1 — frozen at `phase-9b1-frozen`**

**Phase 9B2A — frozen (`phase-9b2a-frozen`)**

Frozen implementation SHA: `60ebf493ba90114c4f03048558e316ac07118ee2`

**Phase 9B2B — design contract candidate / implementation not started**

**Phase 9C — not started**

This branch contains the first WorldPack's local Phase 7 permanent build-choice
slice and the frozen Phase 7.5 named actor, relationship, and knowledge slice.
slice. Phase 9A is frozen at `phase-9a-frozen` and covers only the minimal
external-client session protocol using a supplied canonical initial GameState.
Phase 9B1 is the frozen bounded World Draft compilation slice at
`phase-9b1-frozen`: it validates strict
JSON, binds one reviewed mechanics profile to a deterministic Compiled WorldPack,
materializes an initial GameState, runs a scripted bootstrap smoke test, and
publishes a verified compiled bundle. It does not create formal Campaigns,
SQLite sessions, or narration. The Phase 7 build effects remain the explicit
`window_runner`, `field_rest`, and `quick_rest` candidates only; none of these
phases introduces a general framework. Phase 9B2A is the frozen Player-Visible
Projection Map at `phase-9b2a-frozen`: it adds a supplemental display-label
draft, a detached deterministic presentation sidecar, a separate presentation
hash, and a verified four-file projection bundle without changing the canonical
Engine request or creating a Campaign, Session, SQLite database, or Narration
layer. Phase 9B2B is a design contract candidate; implementation has not
started. Phase 9C has not started.

## Legacy Implementation

The previous implementation is preserved for reference:
- Branch: `legacy/2026-07-31`
- Tag: `legacy-engine-2026-07-31`

**Do not modify these references.** They are read-only documentation of the legacy engine.

## Architecture Principles

1. **State First**: All game facts live in deterministic state
2. **Events as Truth**: Every change is recorded as an immutable event
3. **Replayability**: Any state can be reconstructed from events
4. **Agent Testing**: Designed for automated testing by scripted/LLM agents
5. **Minimal Core**: No abstractions for unimplemented features

## Development Phases

Phases 1–6 establish the deterministic core, action validation, replay and
the first gameplay slices. Phase 7 is frozen at `phase-7-frozen`; Phase 7.5 is
frozen at `phase-7.5-frozen`; Phase 8 is frozen at `phase-8-frozen`; Phase 9A is
frozen at `phase-9a-frozen`; Phase 9B1 is frozen at `phase-9b1-frozen`; Phase
9B2A is frozen at `phase-9b2a-frozen`; Phase 9B2B is a design contract
candidate and implementation has not started. Phase 9C has not started.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .

# Run tests
python -m pytest

# Run a test world
python -m tgn.demo  # (TBD in Phase 1)
```
